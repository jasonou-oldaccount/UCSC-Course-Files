***** TO TEST THE PROGRAM USING MAKE *****
>>>	  "make testp" to test Prim.       <<<
>>>	  "make testd" to test Dijkstra.   <<<
******************************************

==================== ABOUT ====================

This program will implement:
	-Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm (MST)
	-Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm (SSSP)

The graphs will either be a Directed or Undirected graph:
	-Prim MST is an Undirected graph
	-Dijkstra SSSP is a Directed graph
	
Extra Files Provided:
	-Input files: "input1.in", "input2.in", "input3.in"
	-Log files: "input3.log"

==================== USAGE ====================

Usage: ./graph04 [-P / -D] [# start vertex] [input.in / -]

Argv[0] Should be calling the program
Argv[1] Should be either options -P or -D where -P indicates using MST
		and -D indicates SSSP
Argv[2] Should be the start vertex
Argv[3] Should be either an input file or - which indicates reading from stdin

==================== OUTPUT ====================

Using input from a file that I submitted: "input3.in",
and the command-line command: "graph04 -P 1 input3.in",
I got the output in the file that I submitted: "input3.log"

==================== MAKEFILE ====================

make or make graph04:
	-compiles graph04 to be used

make testp:
	-tests Prim using "input3.in"
	
make testd:
	-test Dijkstra using "input3.in"

make clean:
	-cleans up all of the .o files by removing them
	
make submit:
	-submits files to class folder
